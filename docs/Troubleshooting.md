## General Issues
- **Blender Crashing or Not Responding:**  
  - Ensure your system meets Blender's minimum requirements.
  - Update your graphics drivers and use the latest version of Blender.
  - Try resetting Blender to default settings from the splash screen.

## Object & Mesh Problems
- **Default Cube Not Deleting:**  
  - Double-check that you have correctly selected the cube (and any other selected objects) before pressing **X**.
  - Confirm deletion by pressing **Enter**.
- **Monkey Mesh Not Appearing:**  
  - Verify you pressed **Shift + A** and navigated to **Mesh > Monkey**.
  - Check the viewport to ensure the object isnâ€™t hidden or placed outside the cameraâ€™s view.
- **Modifiers Not Applying Correctly:**  
  - Review the Modifier Properties tab to ensure the correct modifier (e.g., Subdivision Surface) is added.
  - Ensure there are no conflicting modifiers affecting the mesh.

## Material & Shading Issues
- **Materials Not Displaying:**  
  - Switch to the **Material Preview** or **Rendered** viewport shading mode.
  - Check that a material has been properly created and applied to the object.
- **Shading Smooth Not Taking Effect:**  
  - Right-click the object and select **Shade Smooth**.
  - Adjust the settings in the **Subdivision Surface Modifier** if needed.

## Lighting & Camera Issues
- **Poor or Inadequate Lighting:**  
  - Confirm that your light source (e.g., Point Light) is positioned correctly relative to your object.
  - Adjust the light's power in the Data tab to achieve the desired brightness.
- **Camera Not Framing the Object:**  
  - Use viewport navigation tools to reposition the camera.
  - Ensure the camera is correctly set as the active camera and that the object is in focus.

## Render Problems
- **Render Output Not Appearing:**  
  - Make sure youâ€™ve selected **Render Image** from the Render menu.
  - Verify that the active camera is properly positioned and that your scene includes sufficient lighting.
- **Dark or Overexposed Render:**  
  - Adjust the lightâ€™s power or modify the cameraâ€™s exposure settings.
  - Check any environmental or background settings that might be affecting the overall brightness.

## Additional Tips
- **Save Frequently:**  
  - Use **Ctrl + S** to save your progress often to prevent data loss.
- **Consult the Blender Community:**  
  - The Blender forums and online communities are excellent resources for more complex issues.
